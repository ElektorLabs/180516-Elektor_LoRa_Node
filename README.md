# LoRaWAN Node Experimental Platform 

## Warning this is work in progress

This is the hardware and software repository for the LoRaWAN Node Experimental Platform, currently being work in porgress.
The first prototype has been produced and we are going to improve the PCB as we will use it more than for one project. 

Also this will contain the basic software for the LoRaWAN Node Experimental Platform making it an universal tool to test and play arround with.
For more information and the motivation also to share the KiCad files with you have a look at https://www.elektormagazine.com/labs/lorawan-node-experimental-platform
If you are new to KiCad and like to modify the PCB on your own, fell free , and if you need a good book to start with KiCad have a look at: https://www.elektor.com/kicad-like-a-pro
