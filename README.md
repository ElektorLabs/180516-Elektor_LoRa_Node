# Elektor LoRa Node

## This is a Elektor LoRa Node based on a STM32F072

This is the hardware and software repository for the Elektor LoRa node.
This is open hardware under the CERN OHL v1.2, so feel free to grab your copy and have fun. 
Also this project is done with KiCad, so you can have a look at the files without software that costs a fortune.

Under the Hardware folder you will find (besides the project files) the PDF files for the board schematics.  

For more information and the motivation also to share the KiCad files with you have a look at https://www.elektormagazine.com/labs/lorawan-node-experimental-platform
If you are new to KiCad and would like to modify the PCB on your own, feel free, and if you need a good book to start with KiCad have a look at: https://www.elektor.com/kicad-like-a-pro

## Getting Started

Grab a copy of KiCad and download the repository, or just grab the schematics to get an idea of the board.

For the software grab a copy of the Arduino IDE and install the STM32 core support for Arduino ( https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32 )
You can use the excellent guide provided here : https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32#getting-started
